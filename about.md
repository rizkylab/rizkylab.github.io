# About Me

My name is **Rizky Sulityo**.

I have been working as an IT Security professional for five years, and since 2017, I started working as an IT Infrastructure Engineer. However, I was always interested in developing secure systems, so in 2019, I transitioned into IT Security Pentesting and started working remotely. I am responsible for **Penetration Testing** and establishing an **ISMS** program to support and maintain **ISO 27001 certification** and its implementation.
